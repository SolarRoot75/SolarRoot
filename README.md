##### Hi, I'm SolarRoot, a student in the field of cybersecurity at Ecole 2600 and also an apprentice working as an analyst specializing in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), which is a fascinating field.

##### I am primarily interested in Python and Docker, but I am also open to PowerShell and C (I have already practiced Bash, which I no longer use, and Java, for which I have only learned the basics, as well as HTML/CSS).

##### Outside of development, I am learning digital forensics out of passion and also a bit about pentesting (Bug Bounty).
